== Prerequisites

* Version {game-version} of the game. As the game is still in early access, this mod may not work with future versions of the game. If you encounter any issues, please create an https://github.com/{repo}/issues[Issue].
* https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx[BepInEx] version BepInEx Version

== Setup

You can install the mod from https://thunderstore.io/c/techtonica/p/3_141/TechtonicaVR/[Thunderstore] or install it manually:

=== BepInEx
. Download the latest 5.x release of BepInEx from the https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases[Releases] page.
. Extract the downloaded archive into the game's installation directory.
. Run the game once. BepInEx should be installed automatically.

=== VR Mod
// x-release-please-start-version
. Download the latest release (v0.6.0) of this mod from the https://github.com/{repo}/releases[Releases] page.
// x-release-please-end
. Extract the downloaded archive.
. Copy the `BepInEx` and `Techtonica_Data` folders to the `Techtonica` folder in `steamapps/common` directory.
. Run the game. The mod should be loaded automatically by BepInEx.

=== Dependencies
The github release bundles the dependencies with the mod. The thunderstore release does not include the dependencies. You need to install them separately or use a mod manager that can install dependencies.

==== TTIK (Required)
This mod requires the https://github.com/Xenira/TTIK[TTIK] mod to be installed. This mod adds inverse kinematics (IK) to the game. This is required to render the player's body in VR. It also allows both VR and non-VR players to see the player's body movements. When playing co-op, the host needs to have this mod installed. For other non-VR players the mod is optional.

==== PiUtils (Required)
This mod requires the https://github.com/Xenira/PiUtils[PiUtils] mod to be installed. This mod provides some utility functions that are used by the VR mod.

==== Audio Fix (Optional)
Teleport and Snap turn have audio cues that are not played unless https://github.com/toebeann/Tobey.UnityAudio[Tobey.UnityAudio] is installed. You can install it from https://thunderstore.io/package/toebeann/TobeyUnityAudio/[Thunderstore] or the https://github.com/toebeann/Tobey.UnityAudio/releases[GitHub Releases] page.

To manually install the UnityAudio extract the `BepInEx` folder from the downloaded archive into the game's installation directory.

=== Disabling the Mod
To disable the mod change the `Enabled` under `[General]` value in the `de.xenira.techtonica.cfg` file in the `BepInEx/config` folder to `false`.

=== Uninstalling the Mod
To uninstall the mod remove the mod's files from the `BepInEx/plugins` folder. This should be the following files:

- 'techtonica_vr' folder

If you installed the audio fix, remove the `BepInEx/patches/Tobey/UnityAudio` and `BepInEx/plugin/Tobey/UnityAudio` folder from the game's installation directory.

There will be some leftover files in the `Techtonica_Data` folder. To clean those up, delete the folder and verify the game's files in Steam. This will redownload the game's files and remove any leftover files. This is not strictly necessary but it will keep your game folder clean.

== Current State
While the mod is in a playable state, it is still in early development. Some features are still missing and there are some known issues. Other things might be a little yanky or not work as expected.

=== Working
- Rendering of the game world with 6DOF Tracking
- Tracking of the player's head and hands
- Smooth locomotion and turning
- Comfort options (Teleportation, Snap turning, Vignette)
- Basic controller bindings (Although they might not be optimal)
- Controller haptics
- Smooth turning
- UI

=== Missing
- Gesture support (e.g. Mining using pickaxe motion)
- Model for the player's body. Currently not a priority as this requires IK.
- Default bindings for VR controllers other than the Valve Index Controllers (#16, #17)
- Object outlines. Disabled for now as the shader is broken in VR.
- Finger tracking (#15)
- Ability to switch primary hand
- Ability to yeet paladin down the waterfall
- Hand crank using uhhhhh... hands?

=== Known Issues
- Haptics are played on both controllers by the game. One improvement would be to play them on the hand that is actually holding the tool.
- The game is locked to 60fps when running in windowed mode. This is based on the refresh rate of your monitor. To unlock the framerate, switch to fullscreen mode. (#10)

=== Cool stuff to try
- Tobii eye tracking for dynamic foveated rendering
- Enable ik (The game ships with `FinalIK` so it should be possible. Probably just not networked yet.)

== Configuration
The configuration file is located in `BepInEx/config/de.xenira.techtonicavr.cfg`. You can edit it using a text editor like Notepad.

=== Resetting the Configuration
To reset the configuration, delete the `de.xenira.techtonicavr.cfg` file in the `BepInEx/config` folder. The mod will create a new configuration file with the default values the next time you run the game.

To reset only a specific section, delete the section from the configuration file. The mod will create a new section with the default values the next time you run the game.

=== Q&A
[qanda]
Why is my framerate locked to 60fps?::
The game is locked to x fps when running in Windowed mode. This is based on the refresh rate of your monitor. To unlock the framerate, switch to fullscreen mode. (For now)
I am experiencing periodic stuttering / freezes. What can I do?::
This is most likely caused by autosave. Try setting the autosave interval to a higher value using the https://thunderstore.io/c/techtonica/p/UnFoundBug/AutoSaveConfig/[AutoSaveConfig] mod.
The games performance is bad. What can I do?::
Try lowering the graphics settings. VR is very demanding and the game is not optimized for VR. While I am working on improving the performance, there is only so much I can do.
Does this mod work with Gamepass?::
Yes, the mod needs to be installed in `Gamepass/Techtonica/Content`.
// AI generated below :P
Why is the mod not open source?::
It is. You are looking at the source right now (duh!).
Why is the mod not on NexusMods?::
I don't like NexusMods. I don't like their ToS and I don't like their mod manager. I don't want to support them.
