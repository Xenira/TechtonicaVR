This is a mod for the game https://store.steampowered.com/app/1457320/Techtonica/[Techtonica] that adds VR support.

CAUTION: This mod is still in early development and *will* contain bugs. Use at your own risk. Only tested with the Valve Index / Pimax Crystal and Knuckles controllers.

== Prerequisites

* Version {game-version} of the game. As the game is still in early access, this mod may not work with future versions of the game. If you encounter any issues, please create an https://github.com/{repo}/issues[Issue].
* https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx[BepInEx] version BepInEx Version

== Setup

You can install the mod from https://thunderstore.io/c/techtonica/p/3_141/TechtonicaVR/[Thunderstore] or install it manually:

=== BepInEx
. Download the latest 5.x release of BepInEx from the https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases[Releases] page.
. Extract the downloaded archive into the game's installation directory.
. Run the game once. BepInEx should be installed automatically.

=== VR Mod
// x-release-please-start-version
. Download the latest release (v0.2.5) of this mod from the https://github.com/{repo}/releases[Releases] page.
// x-release-please-end
. Extract the downloaded archive.
. Copy the `BepInEx` and `Techtonica_Data` folders to the `Techtonica` folder in `steamapps/common` directory.
. Run the game. The mod should be loaded automatically by BepInEx.

=== Audio Fix
Teleport and Snap turn have audio cues that are not played unless https://github.com/toebeann/Tobey.UnityAudio[Tobey.UnityAudio] is installed. You can install it from https://thunderstore.io/package/toebeann/TobeyUnityAudio/[Thunderstore] or the https://github.com/toebeann/Tobey.UnityAudio/releases[GitHub Releases] page.

- The GitHub release of the VR mod includes the audio fix so you don't need to install it separately.
- The thunderstore release does not include the audio fix unless you install it using a mod manager that installs dependencies.

To manually install the UnityAudio extract the `BepInEx` folder from the downloaded archive into the game's installation directory.

=== Disabling the Mod
To disable the mod change the `Enabled` under `[General]` value in the `de.xenira.techtonica.cfg` file in the `BepInEx/config` folder to `false`.

=== Uninstalling the Mod
To uninstall the mod remove the mod's files from the `BepInEx/plugins` folder. This should be the following files:

- `techtonica_vr.dll`
- 'techtonica_vr' folder

If you installed the audio fix, remove the `BepInEx/patches/Tobey/UnityAudio` and `BepInEx/plugin/Tobey/UnityAudio` folder from the game's installation directory.

There will be some leftover files in the `Techtonica_Data` folder. To clean those up, delete the folder and verify the game's files in Steam. This will redownload the game's files and remove any leftover files. This is not strictly necessary but it will keep your game folder clean.

== Current State
While the mod is in a playable state, it is still in early development. Some features are still missing and there are some known issues. Other things might be a little yanky or not work as expected.

=== Working
- Rendering of the game world with 6DOF Tracking
- Tracking of the player's head and hands
- Smooth locomotion and turning
- Comfort options (Teleportation, Snap turning, Vignette)
- Basic controller bindings (Although they might not be optimal)
- Controller haptics
- Smooth turning
- UI

=== Missing
- Gesture support (e.g. Mining using pickaxe motion)
- Model for the player's body. Currently not a priority as this requires IK.
- Default bindings for VR controllers other than the Valve Index Controllers (#16, #17)
- Object outlines. Disabled for now as the shader is broken in VR.
- Finger tracking (#15)
- Ability to switch primary hand
- Ability to yeet paladin down the waterfall
- Hand crank using uhhhhh... hands?

=== Known Issues
- Button prompts are not for VR controllers. (#13)
- Haptics are played on both controllers by the game. One improvement would be to play them on the hand that is actually holding the tool.
- The game is locked to 60fps when running in windowed mode. This is based on the refresh rate of your monitor. To unlock the framerate, switch to fullscreen mode. (#10)
- Menus are a little jittery (#18)

=== Cool stuff to try
- Tobii eye tracking for dynamic foveated rendering
- Enable ik (The game ships with `FinalIK` so it should be possible. Probably just not networked yet.)

== Configuration
The configuration file is located in `BepInEx/config/de.xenira.techtonica.cfg`. You can edit it using a text editor like Notepad.

=== Resetting the Configuration
To reset the configuration, delete the `de.xenira.techtonica.cfg` file in the `BepInEx/config` folder. The mod will create a new configuration file with the default values the next time you run the game.

To reset only a specific section, delete the section from the configuration file. The mod will create a new section with the default values the next time you run the game.
